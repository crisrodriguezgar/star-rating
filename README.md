# ✨ Star Rating

:star::star::star::star::star:

This is a project that I have done with Lit Element and Web Components technologies to learn and practice. I have made a component called ```<cris-rating>``` to build a star ranking for any web page that needs it.

## 📋 Initial Requeriments

- Create a component called ```<cris-rating></cris-rating>```
- Paint title, with the text attribute or set a default property.
- Paint as many stars as you want with the star-count attribute.
- Use the rating to fill in that number of stars.
- If you have a rating, a text box should appear below to leave more comments.

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to minimize the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.

# ‚ú® Star Rating

:star::star::star::star::star:

This is a project that I have done with Lit Element and Web components to learn and practice these technologies. This is a component called <cris-rating> to build a star ranking.

## Installation

```bash
npm i cris-rating
```

## Usage

```html
<script type="module">
  import 'cris-rating/cris-rating.js';
</script>

<cris-rating></cris-rating>
```

## Linting and formatting

To scan the project for linting and formatting errors, run

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting and formatting errors, run

```bash
npm run format
```

## Demoing with Storybook

To run a local instance of Storybook for your component, run

```bash
npm run storybook
```

To build a production version of Storybook, run

```bash
npm run storybook:build
```


## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to minimize the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.

## Local Demo with `web-dev-server`

```bash
npm start
```

To run a local development server that serves the basic demo located in `demo/index.html`
